# JWT Authentication App

https://authentication-app-front-end-two.vercel.app/

This is a simple full stack application developed using **Node, Express** for the back-end, **React** for the front-end and **MongoDB** for the database. The application consists of a simple registration and login page, which have various server side validations placed on the inputs. Once you have successfully registered an account and then login using the account, the authentication is performed based on the JSON web token and once it is verified, then you can access protected content.
